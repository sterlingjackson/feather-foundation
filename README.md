# feather-foundation

Feather is designed to be a simple, lightweight PHP foundation for building web applications. It not intended to be a comprehensive or opinionated framework but a simple foundation that helps provide some plumbing to quickly build on top of.

One of main goals of Feather is to produce an incredibly simply, elegant platform that isn't over-engineered and doesn't create a heavy layer of convoluted abstractions.
